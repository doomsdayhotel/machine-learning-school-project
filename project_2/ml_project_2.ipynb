Before arriving, I was picturing a space that was enclosed behind a door at the top of the stairs.

You can hear outside noise, but that’s to be expected. What’s not expected was being able to hear everything from the hosts upstairs. VERY thin walls. We could hear them walking around, opening doors, coughing, etc. Also their bird. I don’t know what kind of bird it was, but it’s a loud screeching type, not a small chirping bird. It wasn’t very active until the morning we were checking out when it was squawking very loudly all morning long. The hosts were also stomping around upstairs, repeatedly going up and down the stairs outside the apt door, and opening/closing heavy doors all morning. I don’t know whether all of this activity was intentional, but since no other morning was that excessively noisy other than the one on check out day, it sure felt intentional and very rude. Maybe they have had other guests overstay past check out time, but that’s really no reason to punish future guests.\\n\\nThere are better deals with the new pod hotels that are cleaner and closer to where you want to be.

The location felt safe and although we didn’t go out much because of the pandemic, it’s within walking distance of lots of coffee shops, corner groceries, and restaurants. We visited beautiful Fort Greene Park a number of times, about a block away. There’s a great farmers market there on Saturdays.',\n",

Great value for such a large space.\",\n",

The place is amazing, from decor to patio, to the way everything has been arranged.  Even the old style bathroom was cool.  If it wasn’t for Covid there’d be a lot of bars open nearby.  Still, a great experience if you want to stay in.',\n",
       " 'Nathalie’s home is an absolute dream in the heart of Bed- Stuy. Booking couldn’t have been a simpler process as Nathalie is extremely communicative and responded nearly immediately. Read the rules! Everything is very clear! No stress check in, arrive and use the lockbox whenever you’re ready. Once you open the door you’re going to fall in love and want to cancel any and all plans to go out (you’re also going to wake up on Sunday and immediately extend your reservation.. just trust me and book Sunday night as well.) The backyard space paired with a glass of wine and the essence of whatever vibe is happening on the block is prime entertainment in and of itself. You’re in the heart of Bed- Stuy with access to the train only a few blocks down giving you the accessibility to explore whatever part of town you’re in the mood for although you can find almost any vibe you’re looking for within a few blocks. Early mornings in Nathalie’s space was really prime time though, the natural light that streams through all the windows in the apartment was so beautiful to wake up to. As someone who’s been traveling to New York over the past few years, Nathalie’s home was genuinely everything I could’ve asked for. Do yourself a favour and experience it for yourself!!',\n",

We spent our days reading, taking baths, and eating pastries and pizza from nearby Saraghina. Nathalie's prompt communication and contact-less check-in made for an easy arrival & settling in.\",\n",
       " 'Nathalie’s place was just lovely and I wanted to write a very honest review for future guests to know exactly what their receiving. I’ve stayed in over 200 Airbnb’s throughout my four year travels and this apartment really stood out for me. The apartment is definitely much more beautiful in person with hand picked pieces that were really put in with love and care. I honestly expected it to be a little dusty because there was a lot of antique pieces but nope, I really felt like home, each pillow I laid on smelled fresh, everything in the apartment was thoroughly cleaned, it just made me feel so comfortable. Nathalie took care of each aspect of the apartment making it warm and cozy with absolutely gorgeous finishes. I loved her style and sense of cleanliness, really would have stayed longer if I could.\\n\\nAlso, the neighborhood was quite lovely as well. Lots of art, culture and great food, transport right at your feet. \\n\\nNathalie was always prompt in communicating back and making sure my stay was going well. This was an awesome place to stay, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and I hope there will be availability in the future. \\n\\nThank you kindly Nathalie for having us, we really appreciate your hospitality.',\n",

So unique, amazing natural light, and you can tell how thoughtfully everything has been chosen in the apartment - overall it’s one of my favorite places I’ve stayed. Great location & Nathalie was super communicative & accommodating as well. Would love to stay again in the future',\n",

       " \"Dana's place has multiple things going for it, not least being location. It's convenient to a lot in the neighbourhood. The space itself  was nice and comfortable. It's a little bit dark, though no more so than any other East Village place. Because I was there during COVID and cooking more than I would have otherwise I did note that the kitchen doesn't have a lot of working space. But that's going to be an individual preference.\\n\\nDana was very easy to reach and made everything smooth and simple. She was a great host, and I'd recommend her place to anyone.\",\n",
       " \"Dana's apartment is beautiful. The bedroom is spacious with tons of natural light. the living area is spacious as well with attached kitchen which is standard NYC size (small). the shower is great, it is a 4th floor walk up which I personally love (good exercise) and allows for amazing light in the apartment which you dont always get in Manhattan, especially East Village and older neighborhoods. Dana's response time was consistently lightning fast which I very much appreciated! she was helpful and accommodating. highly recommend and would def stay again! ❤\",\n",

She responded within 5 mins of me needing anything. She was happy and always willing to go above and beyond for anything I needed. She’s a sweetheart and she made it feel like it was my own home. Definitely recommend this place to anyone',\n",
       " 'Laurie’s place is a gem, perfectly located in prime Park Slope, which is basically New York’s version of Islington. The house is a quirky, older home, warm and welcoming. Laurie is an extremely interesting person, friendly, knowledgeable and delighted to chat about everything from the locality to the state of the world. The upstairs rear bedroom I had was quiet and comfortable - I slept particularly well. It’s probably worth noting that the house could be tricky for anyone not steady on their feet as the stairs are narrow and steep. But don’t worry about taking bags up there - Laurie is more than happy to let guests keep heavy bags downstairs. The bathroom is shared if there’s another guest in residence, but the arrangement wasn’t at all stressful - and even though the plumbing isn’t in it’s salad days, the shower is super powerful in the best American tradition - which was a pleasure each morning. Highly recommended, an easy subway trip to the varied neighbourhoods of Brooklyn and to Manhattan beyond.',\n",

For anyone arriving with heavy bags or who may have mobility challenges, I would note that this is a third floor walk-up with three sets of stairs total up to the apartment.',\n",

Privacy was on point & I never felt unsafe while there.\\n\\nNote that the unit is in the 4th floor with no elevators. Wasn’t bothersome for me but might be for others.

I recommend this space as strongly as possible. Incredible. I honestly feel so lucky to have stayed there.\",\n",
       " \"James's loft in East Williamsburg is an amazing space perfect for 2 people or 2 couples with a bedroom and a separate loft space. James is a photographer and his creative sense is well-represented in his thoughtful, stylish, quirky furnishings and decorations. Fun, artful, and beautiful details abound such as \\n\\nThe dramatic photos should give you a sense of how much space there is! The loft features very high ceilings, around 12 feet, huge windows facing both east and west for incredible natural light in the morning and afternoon.\\n\\nThe common spaces include a kitchen, dining area, and living room with two couches, two leather armchairs, and a huge white backdrop that doubles as a projector wall for night time video watching with James's bright HD projector. As a note, we stayed in the heart of the New York's hot and humid summer and the loft does not have central air conditioning, so it gets hot inside. You can open the screened windows wide and there are two big portable fans to circulate the air. Given the age of the building, the size of the windows, it may also get chilly in the winter. There are built-in heaters in the bedroom and common area that we, summer visitors, understandably, never tried.\\n\\nThere is a well-appointed kitchen with a dining table for 6 diners, and a large commercial kitchen counter for prep work. We stayed for two weeks and cooked regularly using the pots, pans, gas stove, oven, microwave, and refrigerator. There is a drip coffee maker, but we used the French press for our caffeine needs.\\n\\nThe bedroom is completely enclosed and is the only space with air-conditioning. Since its a small window unit, it does cool the bedroom, but it isn't able to cool the rest of the space. The loft does have much less headroom, someone tall will need to duck to move around. There is plenty of space to hang your clothes, store them in dressers and shelves, store your luggage.\\n\\nUnder the loft is the office and the bathroom. The office features an old-fashioned office desk and chair, paired with decent 20Mb downstream Wifi connection. Ideal for working in the day, streaming videos at night.\\n\\nThe loft is on the 4th and top floor of an old industrial building which gives it much of its unique character, charm, and a dramatic view of its Brooklyn surroundings. However, there is no elevator and the floors are tall (enabling loft spaces) meaning you will have to carry all your luggage up and down 4 extra high floors. I am fit and was winded by the time I reached the fourth floor. If you not comfortable climbing stairs, this space may not be right for you.\\n\\nThe building is perfectly located between the JMZ and L trains in a lively Brooklyn neighborhood. It's a great base to explore Brooklyn and Manhattan. It is easy walking distance to coffee shops, grocers, and restaurants. World renown Roberta's Pizza is two blocks away. Subways stations are under 10 minutes walk away can take you to central Williamsburg, East Village, Bowery, Downtown, Midtown, and anywhere you want to go on Manhattan.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a Brooklyn adventure, I would whole-heartedly recommend James's beautiful loft.\",\n",

       " 'We spent 9 weeks at Dimitri\\'s place (late October through December 2020). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Dimitri himself could not be more gracious and helpful as host. He lives upstairs (3rd floor) and his family lives on 1st floor. They are all musicians but very respectful of quiet hours. The location, security and condition of this 2nd floor apartment is OUTSTANDING, especially for anyone staying in the Prospect Heights/Park Slope area. Easy walk to scenic outdoor areas like Prospect Park and the Botanic Garden (reservation-only during pandemic). In healthier times, there will be dozens of great restaurants, bars, stores and city parks nearby too. Check-in was seamless, with Dimitri willing to help however needed. If you have a car, the fireplug out front provides a great short-term unloading zone. Street parking is competitive; we rented space in one of many nearby garages. Nice sitting area at front of building, shrub-lined with gate for privacy. This section of Underhill Avenue seems very quiet, with low pedestrian traffic (and almost everyone wears a mask). Apartment is quite large by Brooklyn standards, and window-filled for lots of light. It has an open living-dining-kitchen area, wood floors with area rugs (NO SHOES policy), huge master with en suite full bathroom, 2nd full bathroom off hallway, large 2nd bedroom and 2 smaller bedrooms which could also be used as office space. Each bedroom has a \"reach-in\" closet for storage. Kitchen has good cabinet space, 4-burner gas stove/oven, full frig, dishwasher, and many nice cooking/dining supplies. Kitchen and both baths have lots of granite (latter with tub/shower combos). No washer/dryer (for our longer stay, Dimitri provided clean linens+towels every 2 weeks). Nice TV with DVD; has usual \"goosey\" DISH-TV (think host may change this soon). Great WIFI coverage and central heating. Every apartment has a door-buzzer system, so all deliveries can be left in 1st floor entry hall to allow NO CONTACT access. Everyone onsite follows Dr Fauci\\'s advice-- wearing masks, social distancing and minimizing contact to protect each other. Dimitri\\'s  apartment made it possible for us  senior citizens to feel safe and snug amidst resurging pestilence, a fall heat wave, 2 snow storms and that ever-present \"COVID cabin fever\". We definitely would recommend this apartment to our family and friends!',\n",

With that said- the reason for the 3 stars- there were little notes everywhere- don’t touch this, don’t sit on this, put this here.. etc etc. it made me feel really uncomfortable. I felt like a toddler afraid to touch anything or leave something out of place. Also, there are strict rules posted everywhere- put trash here, compost here, plastic there. Put towels here, use this for this etc. etc. if I’m cleaning everything in the house, why the extra $80 cleaning fee? The only thing I wanted was a cup of coffee for the morning- and didn’t see any anywhere. Also- don’t bring a car- parking is non existent. And the neighbors (one lady specifically) was watching us- actually staring and making me very uncomfortable as we were trying to unlock the door.

Understandable though and she's upfront with her rules as well. My issue was that for the price, it was not as accommodating as I wished. I couldn't find the glasses to drink water, me and my boyfriend had to wait for a very long time for the roommate and her boyfriend to leave the bathroom even though we woke up extra early. My boyfriend had to put his contacts on in the kitchen sink and I held my pee for like 2 hours! Very inconsiderate since we were guests and for the price we pay. They knew we were waiting since we kept checking to see if they were done. Also one night, we were awoken by them fighting outside which I understand sometimes happens but was a bit disturbing.

The check in was smooth and easy, and even when I showed up an hour before the agreed time, she still was there and greeted me warmly. She also offered me a room that became available, twice the size that I had booked, for the same price. She also is extremely respectful of everyone’s personal belongings when she comes once a week to clean. Also, she comes once a week to clean! That is the first time I’ve seen such considerate and clean service offered on a monthly Airbnb stay. The bathroom, kitchen, and room were all extremely clean and well stocked with anything I could need. The neighborhood is the perfect location, you feel like your in a calm and quiet neighborhood, but you are 2 blocks from the subway and tons of restaurants/bars/gyms/stores.

Grocery store/deli/restaurants within walking distance (he's blocks from the BEST burger in NYC).  Jitsu (his dog!) is adorable; he stays out of your room unless you invite him in.

Also close to subway stations - very easy to get around. The apartment was clean and well kept. Uli was a great host, and very communicative, quick to respond to messages, and provided helpful information prior to our trip. The only drawback is the check-in and check-out process, which requires you to pick up the keys at a nearby business from a self-serve, electronic key storage box. An extra step and a potential complication if arriving late or tight on time to catch your return flight. Overall, I'd recommend the apartment but plan accordingly and give yourself some extra time for check in and check out in case you experience any issues with the key service as we did upon checking out.\",\n",

Uli was a very responsive host, and answered all my questions in little to no time.',\n",
       " \"If you read some of my other reviews, you'll notice that my husband and I have been chronic stay-cationers in NYC, preferring to explore different neighborhoods when we do have the luxury of staying together sporadically. Out of all the Airbnbs that we've had the pleasure of inhabiting, Uli's place was our definite favorite thus far.   First off, as you can see from the photos, the apartment is impeccably decorated, with some very tongue-in-cheek artwork that I'm a huge fan of. The kitchen is fully furnished with high-end labels, and for a month-long stay, we made good use of the calphalon cookware :) There's multiple routes for the coffee-addicted (as we are), in the form of a Nespresso machine, a French press, or an Italian moka pot. And if your preference is to have someone else make your coffee, I highly recommend Lazy Llama, just a short minute's walk down the block.\\n\\nPrior to check-in, Uli was communicative and ensured that any worries we had about the cleaning and hiccups with check-in were taken care of, and we were able to very easily access KeyCafe to pick up our keys.  During the entire stay, we stayed in touch and he never took more than a few hours to respond.\\n\\nWe are slightly biased because this is our favorite neighborhood, but there's nothing quite like escaping for a walk through Thompkins Square Park, a short jog to the East River promenade, or across the Williamsburg Bridge. Lastly, and most importantly, I was working from home during my stay, and the internet was incredibly reliable for my multiple conference calls and long work days.\",\n",

Based on what I was told it was my understanding that just his sister was in the house and I would be renting a private room and bath in another section of a house.\\nThe guest in the room next to me was incredibly loud and noisy, and given the fact that there are wood floors with no carpeting in an old Brownstone, it is incredibly noisy. Also they were singing or humming all night, banging on walls, and their phone was going off all night.\\nAnd I hope you like cats that meow all night.\\nIt wasn't until 4 or 5 in the morning when things finally got quiet. And by then I had had enough, got ready and just went to the airport. \\nAnd that was five hours before my flight left, I just wanted to get out of there.\\nIt's a nice room, but the mattress is very uncomfortable, the hot water is very temperamental, and unfortunately it was too cold to take advantage of the deck outside the room.\\nI think a lot of these issues could have been avoided had things been communicated more clearly.\\nIt would be nice if you could communicate with the host by phone, rather than sending several messages.\\nAnd unfortunately this ghost host never communicated clearly with his sister who was staying there and what rooms they were in.\\nAnd although you can lock the room from inside, the host never gave his sister a key to lock the door on the rooms when you leave the house. There is absolutely no privacy when you leave the room. Anyone could have had access to it.\\nTo summarize, it's a nice house in a great neighborhood, but lack of communicating all the particulars led to a miserable stay.\",\n",

There was no smoke or carbon monoxide detector in the apt or in the hallway outside it, just blank spaces where they used to be. There is also no control over heat. It was mostly warm but one evening the heat went off randomly and it was chilly. As other reviews have stated, the second bedroom is only accessible through the main bedroom which was fine for us, but possibly not for everyone.',\n",

I had a defective key for the building main entrance and had to wait for other people to open the door for me and was provided a key not exactly immediatly. After that, I can say the place isn’t exactly as the photos, it’s windows doesn’t have blinds or curtains as shown excepting the bedroom which makes the experience a little weird, and there is no tv as shown in photos although the description does say it doesn’t.\\nBesides this, everything else was okay.',\n",

Our only issue that we had occurred the day of our stay as we were told we had to pay an extra $20 a night after the first guest. Admittedly I happened to miss this detail clearly written in the additional prices area but I’ve never experienced this pricing for an Airbnb so it threw me off to receive a message day of check in that I owe an extra $70 after I already paid the reservation in full a month beforehand. It wasn’t a make or break deal, however, cause we were already en route to the city and the nightly rate was cheap and in a good location but she mentioned that this happens all the time so be sure to double check this factor when determining the pricing and comparing other apartments! Otherwise we had a great stay',\n",

Her appartement is really well located in Williamsburg, close to shops and restaurants, and a short walk to quirky cool Greenpoint as well.

Melissa was very cooperative in dealing with Airbnb and making sure that we could cancel the reservation and that I could see a refund for the unused time.  I am very grateful.

But this was still an awesome place to stay, right in the heart of the east village, with a great kitchen/private laundry/comfortable sleeping location, and astoundingly quiet sleeping with great sealed windows even though right on very busy 1st ave.

The description also mentions street noise, but we didn't hear any of that in the apartment, which made sleeping that much easier.\\n\\nWe did have a few issues though. The bed is soft, which at first was great, but after a little while made our backs ache. There also wasn't much room to hang up our clothes, which is ok once again for a short stay, but for a longer stay made things more inconvenient. There were also some cleaning issues, some of which we resolved ourselves, and others which Samir helped us with, but would have loved to have not been an issue to begin with.\\n\\nAll in all, Samir's place is a great spot from which to explore NYC without having to compromise on space.\",\n",

It is ideal for long stays, being within walking distance to supermarkets, laundromats, more food places than I can count etc. Bad timing, however, was a factor that I had some difficulties during my first couple of weeks in the house.  Damage was done to the apartment from a previous tenant and Henning was away, unable to replace the damaged amenities, hence the bad timing. This resulted in some amenities missing, including a desk chair, which brought some inconvenience since I spend quite a lot of time on my computer.

Subways up and down both the east and west sides are also only a few minutes walk away making it very convenient to get around. I'd highly recommend Per's home if coming to NYC!!!\",\n",

Fully stocked kitchen, quite large bathroom in comparison to other apartments I’ve stayed at in NY. There is so much storage space in the bedroom as well. The balcony is great to sit out on, and so many local stores literally at the doorstep. Would recommend and stay again.',\n",

Perfect location for transportation (subway, bus, cabs everywhere) and Central Park is one block away for a safe and beautiful walk! Great restaurants and close access to stores/grocery for basically anything. Apartment is very clean, well-stocked kitchen and apt necessities, and Per is a very responsive host (even checked in with me when we had a major storm). Little noisy if you’re a light sleeper due to Madison Ave, FYI insomniacs. Otherwise, I would definitely highly recommend his place for your NYC visit!',\n",

It is a block away from central park and we really enjoyed spending time there. Parking is a bit tough, and it is the same everywhere in that location. There was a Lil confusion about the check-out time because of the Airbnb issue but with Per's proactive communication, it was sorted out. The other cohost Giselle was also really helpful with our luggage and check-in process.\",\n",

In the mornings we could hear the foot steps from above, but we had already been warned, and we didn't find it annoying.

My favorite thing about the location was running a loop in the morning across Manhattan Bridge, along Dumbo waterfront, and back on Brooklyn Bridge, then picking up breakfast in LES or Chinatown. I have traveled a lot throughout the world, but that might be my favorite run ANYWHERE.  The apartment is incredibly spacious for Manhattan with gorgeous light. Can't wait to stay there again.\",\n",

The apartment itself was clean and was as described in the listing and above all Michael was very fast in addressing all my queries and assisted to make my stay comfortable. To tell you the truth I hated leaving, but I had to, since Michael was coming back to his place. Please don't hesitate to book Michael's place, you will not be disappointed. P.S the apartment comes with a balcony where you get to see aircraft approach to land in LaGuardia and enjoy a bit of Manhattan skyline especially at night! Thanks Michael and Marc for such a lovely stay!!!\",\n",

Every building this old will have some quirks, and so does this one (e.g., if you're a gourmet chef looking for lots of kitchen space, this isn't the spot for you) but Scott's listing doesn't over-promise and there was nothing that impacted my ability to have an enjoyable stay.  Plus, Scott is a great host and super-eager to assist with anything that goes wrong.  Overall, highly recommended.\",\n",

If you like a cute, cozy, uniquely decorated, artsy space, located in the middle of one of NYC’s most accessible and enjoyable neighborhoods, this is your place. Beds are SO comfy, there was utterly NO noise in the building or from the street, free parking was easy to find nearby, and JMZ subway is a 5 min walk while the G and L trains are only 10. It’s my 4th stay in Williamsburg, and if Lee’s and Tara’s place were always available, I’d never stay anywhere else.  2 (or 3) bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, fully equipped kitchen, washer and dryer, plus lots of extra living space - it really is like the penthouse of my Bohemian dreams. Thanks so much, Lee and Tara. We hated to leave but hope to return.',\n",

I’m not a person who needs a large space, so I just enjoyed everything.\\nQuiet neighborhood with many locals around. I saw only a few tourists. \\nThe best part was the private restroom!\\nI didn’t know not sharing a toilet with anybody would make me feel so safe.\\nAlso, Alicia recommended some restaurants. \\nIf you are looking for a place that has some distance from the center of the city or want to go local, I will definitely recommend Alicia’s!',\n",

(the check in instructions say to confirm where the key will be ahead of time.) it normally wouldn't have been as big of deal to me if i had to wait in the rain a little. however, because i was on crutches it would have been a problem. i needed to know before i arrived that i could get in. \\n\\nit all worked out great in the end though. i highly recommend lisaroxanne's place! and would stay her again.\",\n",

       " 'decent, not great. the bed was comfortable, but the mattress protector had a huge coffee-like stain on it and the bed skirt was dusty. the photos are enhanced to make this below-grade apartment seem brighter than it actually is. minimal amenities; not even any coffee unless someone before you was generous enough to leave some behind. we were left with someone is decaf and some old tea. you can hear outside noise, but that is to be expected. what is not expected was being able to hear everything from the hosts upstairs. very thin walls. we could hear them walking around, opening doors, coughing, etc. also their bird. i do not know what kind of bird it was, but it is a loud screeching type, not a small chirping bird. it was not very active until the morning we were checking out when it was squawking very loudly all morning long. the hosts were also stomping around upstairs, repeatedly going up and down the stairs outside the apt door, and opening/closing heavy doors all morning. i do not know whether all of this activity was intentional, but since no other morning was that excessively noisy other than the one on check out day, it sure felt intentional and very rude. maybe they have had other guests overstay past check out time, but that is really no reason to punish future guests.\\n\\nthere are better deals with the new pod hotels that are cleaner and closer to where you want to be. we will be going that route next time.',\n",

       " 'we spent 9 weeks at dimitri\\'s place (late october through december 2020). we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! dimitri himself could not be more gracious and helpful as host. he lives upstairs (3rd floor) and his family lives on 1st floor. they are all musicians but very respectful of quiet hours. the location, security and condition of this 2nd floor apartment is outstanding, especially for anyone staying in the prospect heights/park slope area. easy walk to scenic outdoor areas like prospect park and the botanic garden (reservation-only during pandemic). in healthier times, there will be dozens of great restaurants, bars, stores and city parks nearby too. check-in was seamless, with dimitri willing to help however needed. if you have a car, the fireplug out front provides a great short-term unloading zone. street parking is competitive; we rented space in one of many nearby garages. nice sitting area at front of building, shrub-lined with gate for privacy. this section of underhill avenue seems very quiet, with low pedestrian traffic (and almost everyone wears a mask). apartment is quite large by brooklyn standards, and window-filled for lots of light. it has an open living-dining-kitchen area, wood floors with area rugs (no shoes policy), huge master with en suite full bathroom, 2nd full bathroom off hallway, large 2nd bedroom and 2 smaller bedrooms which could also be used as office space. each bedroom has a \"reach-in\" closet for storage. kitchen has good cabinet space, 4-burner gas stove/oven, full frig, dishwasher, and many nice cooking/dining supplies. kitchen and both baths have lots of granite (latter with tub/shower combos). no washer/dryer (for our longer stay, dimitri provided clean linens+towels every 2 weeks). nice tv with dvd; has usual \"goosey\" dish-tv (think host may change this soon). great wifi coverage and central heating. every apartment has a door-buzzer system, so all deliveries can be left in 1st floor entry hall to allow no contact access. everyone onsite follows dr fauci\\'s advice-- wearing masks, social distancing and minimizing contact to protect each other. dimitri\\'s  apartment made it possible for us  senior citizens to feel safe and snug amidst resurging pestilence, a fall heat wave, 2 snow storms and that ever-present \"covid cabin fever\". we definitely would recommend this apartment to our family and friends!',\n",
